# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

- I was motivated to learn the introduction steps to starting my own website.
- I built this project to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.
- The problem that this project solved was an ability to store notes from what I learned during the Prework.
- I learned the flow of Git, I learned functions in JavaScript, I learned how to style a website with CSS, and I learned the essentials of HTML to have words on the webpage and much more.
